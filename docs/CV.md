## Profile

First, I am a problem solver; I love to tinker, research, learn, and optimize. I don't particularly appreciate repeating myself, so I am fond of automation which also reduces mistakes. My main focus is container orchestration, I am focused on Kubernetes and its ecosystem to provide scalable, highly available, observable, and secure infrastructures. In this path, I have worked with many public cloud service providers and used many different tools.



I am wearing DevOps Consultant/Engineer hat (and sometimes others) for the past eight years. Prior to that I was mostly focused on TCP/IP networking and worked with vendors such as Juniper Networks, telecom service providers such as Nokia Siemens Networks, and internet service providers like Cable & Wireless, Liberty Media, Telstra, and others.
