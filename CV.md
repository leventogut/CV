#### Profile

As a self-appointed Cloud Native DevOps Engineer, I have filled various roles, been involved in numerous projects, and been part of many teams. 

First of all, I think myself as a solution provider; I love to tinker, research, learn, solve, and optimize then repeat. I'm fanatical about DRY (Don't repeat yourself) & automation which increases quality as it also allows iterative progress. For the past eight years my main focus have been microservices, containerization, and container orchestration, in particular Kubernetes.

Prior to that I was mostly focused on TCP/IP and MPLS networking in ISP (Internet Service Providers), mobile operators, and telecom service providers; worked with vendors such as Juniper Networks, telecom service providers such as Nokia Siemens Networks, and ISPs like Cable & Wireless, Liberty Media, Telstra, and others.

I enjoy coding and creating solutions that make improve processes.

I'm pasionate about:

- Open source
- Knowledge sharing
- Documentation
- Automation
- Iterative process
- Being vendor agnostic
- Balance between quality and time
